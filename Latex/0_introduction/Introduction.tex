\chapter{Introduction and main objectives}
In human history the presence of disease, caused by parasite is always existed. 
Because of the lack of knowledge about medical science and the poor hygienical conditions the deaths caused by infections in history  have had dramatic repercussion on population life. During the bubonic plague of the 14th century for example 25 million of deaths were reported in Europe out of a population of 100 million. 
During the colonization of the Americas the disease imported by the Europeans is one of the main causes of the genocide of the local population. Diseases like smallpox and cholera were unknown in these countries and native americans have not antibodies to them. 



Not only diseases like these two have am incredible cost in term of human life. They have also effect on historical effect. Due to plague in fact in Europe starts the persecution against Jewish people, considered responsible of the illness spread. While in the Americas, the new infection were one of the element that permits at colonist to subdue the inhabitants. 
Others important epidemic, famous for their consequences were Spanish influenza, Smallpox, Typhus, HIV/AIDS and the more recent Covid-19. 
Because of these, is straightforward evidence of the effect that diseases have on our life.

Only in the last three centuries and just in the most developed countries, like Europe and North America, a significant increase in life expectancy have been observed. The mortality is decreased, but the modification in social patterns and the develop of large cities, have had some consequence. It was increased in the $18^{th}$ and $19^{th}$ centuries the frequency and magnitude of epidemics. 
For this reason diseases are an inevitable agents that is involved in our life. Their implications do not concern only our health status. When we are sick, there are modification in our relationship, work, social life. There is also an economic cost to be healed. Only in few nations worldwide treatment is covered free of charge by the state. In the majority, be ill can result in having to sustain excessive cost. Often due to this, people going into debit or to not take care. 
Nowadays, but also in the past when a new disease appears it is very important try to understand its origin, the biological mechanism under its spread, comprehend its resistance to existent drugs and so on. In practice collect all the information available to understand what is happening.  
These are part of the epidemiological investigation. Other key dimensions are for example genetic resistance, selective pressure of a disease on different human communities, the mechanism underline the acquisition of immunity. Using this knowledge epidemiology try to make a step further of only reconstruct the cause behind the development of a disease: model how can evolute during time.

\end{figure}
There is a lot of interest about this topic both from a scientific perspective and also for public society regulations.
Develop a model that can give us the capability of estimate phenomena like the spread of a disease have a multitude of effects and outcomes on the society.  Social and economic costs are related to every illness, but develop instruments to better understand its impact can avoid the losses of human life and permit to have less serious effect on the society. 
A first simple example, that can help to understand the beneficial effect of study epidemics is the possibility to develop instruments that can permits to consider the specificity of each different disease with "simple" parameters and obtain information like:

\begin{itemize}
	\item is this disease so infective that can cause a pandemic?
	\item what are the threshold conditions that can cause an outbreak? 
\end{itemize}


At a first look the problem can seem simple. Unfortunately, the creation of a model capable of perform an evaluation like the one explained above, suitable for every disease is a problem for which there is not still a solution. 
Every research about the creation of a model that try to represent a real phenomenon must confront with the necessity to simplify, while trying to not loss in accuracy. 
So, in a century of research, many different aspects regarding an epidemic have been considered. The scientist try to catch the most significant ones to develop their model and then figure out if it is capable to give them insights about the considered disease.

The research field regarding the development of technique to understand how epidemics can evolve during time has a history starting back in the 20th century. The first important discovery in this field must be attributed to the scientists that find the mechanism used by disease to spread. 
A first innovative work is the one done by John Snow, that during an epidemic of Cholera in London in 1854 successfully determined the source of the infection, even without knowing its etiological agent. Then advancing in the microbiological research is conducted by Pasteur and Koch. They found the etiological agent of disease, enabling the possibility to treat and prevent people from an infection. 
Then, Hamer work in 1906 added a first major theoretical contribution. He formulated a theory about the correlation between the course of an epidemic and the interaction, contact ratio, between susceptible and infectious individuals. It is the so called “mass -action” principle. The number of contacts between these two groups determines the spread rate of the disease. 
This law originally written in discrete time, is then updated in 1908 by Ross, that re-written it  in continuous time. For the first time the problem can be studied using a clearly, well defined mathematical theory. Then the contributions of Kermack and McKendrick in 1927 add another fundamental principle to the modern epidemiology. They formulated a threshold theory explaining which condition can generate the development of an epidemic. The theorem affirms that a certain value must be exceed, depending on the proportion of susceptible and infectious individual. Controlling this value permits to understand if the number of infections will increase, until a peak is reached or if the epidemic is a descendent phase \cite{Mata2021}, \cite{Anderson_82}. 
Their contribution with the mass action principle represents the base for the mean field model theory, that will be presented and analysed in section \ref{subsec:SIR}. 



\subsection{Epidemiological glossary}
To permit a better comprehension of the subject analyzed in the present work a list of principal concepts and terms is presented.

\subsubsection{Micro and Macro parasite}
	The first difference when presenting infection is distinguishing the type of origin that can cause it. An etiological organism responsible for a disease can be divided into microparasite and macroparasite. The former live and reproduce within the host, generating an immune response and the infections caused by them usually have two possible outcomes: death or immunity. Infections origins from them are shorter than the life span of an individual, and so have a transient nature.
\subsubsection{Types of infectious diseases}
Infectious disease is indicated as an illness resulting from the presence of a pathogenic microbial agent. It is possible to distinguish a difference between \textit{transmittable} and \textit{communicable} disease. A transmittable disease can transmitted between persons through unnatural forces. A disease is communicable when the transmission happens directly or indirectly.

\subsubsection{Disease transmission} A disease can transmit in different ways: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item person to person, for example sexual transmission, involving direct or indirect contact.
		\item airborne, through inhalation of infected air.
		\item food or water borne, ingesting contaminated food. 
		\item vector born, the contagion is caused by infected animals.
	\end{itemize}
	Furthermore when the diffusion is among the same generations is called horizontal transmission, while vertical transmission is the one developing between different generations, from parents to children. 
	Zoonosis is the phenomenon in which a disease that starts in an animal species mutates and attacks humans. The opposite can also happen and it is called inverse-zoonosis. 
	
\subsubsection{Epidemic disease} It occurs when there is a disease with a rapid outbreak, in less than a year there is its development and a peak is reached. The illness is confined to a limited region

\subsubsection{Endemic disease} It is a disease that lasts for a long time and requires consideration of its impact on population renewal and in the number of susceptible individuals.

\subsubsection{Pandemic disease} It is an epidemic that diffuses across multiple regions, on a global scale. The severity of the disease also makes a distinction in calling a disease a pandemic. For example, a common cold is diffused in the whole world but is not defined as a pandemic by the WHO (World Health Organization). 

\subsubsection{Incubation, Symptoms, Infected and Infectious}   A person having contact with another infectious individual, can or not become infected. The incubation is the period after being infected in which the infection increases in size or number in the host but does not produce the symptoms, that are the effect of the disease. 

\subsubsection{Outbreak} Is the rapid raise in the number of infected during an epidemic.

\subsubsection{Incidence and prevalence} The first term refers to the number of new cases after a certain period (daily or weekly for example), while prevalence is the proportion of the population affected by a disease in a specific time.

\subsubsection{Immunity and herd immunity} Immunity is protection from a disease gained after having contracted it. It can last forever or vanish after a certain time. New exposure to the virus does not lead to infection. Herd immunity is instead an important phenomenon in which the defense against a disease is due to the majority of the population being immune, thanks to vaccines or surviving it. This majority protects the rest of the population because slows down the diffusion or stops the spread of the illness.

\subsubsection{Virulence and Contagiousness}  Virulence is used to describe how aggressive, harmful, and pathogenic is a biological agent in attacking cells. Contagiousness is referred to an individual and it is used to represent the capability to transmit a disease. 

\subsubsection{Overdispersion and Superspreading} Overdispersion is a term that refers to observing a larger variance than expected from a normal distribution. It is used in statistics to measure superspreading, a circumstance in which there is an anomaly (higher) number of secondary infections.

\subsubsection{CFR, IFR and mortality excess} The case fatality rate is the ratio between the number of deaths due to a specific disease and the total number of confirmed positive cases. It is the likelihood for an infected person to die because of the infection. The infection fatality rate is instead the percentage of people infected with the disease that are expected to die. The two quantities can have a similar value: if every person who contracts the disease and every death attributable to the disease is known and recorded, then the CFR will equal the IFR.
The excess in mortality can be calculated by observing the difference between the total death rate (due to any reason) a month per month in a comparison between a year with an epidemic and one without. 

\subsubsection{Reproduction number $R_0$} It is the fundamental measure of the infectiousness of a disease. It is the average number of secondary infections caused by one infected person in a fully susceptible population. If it is recalculated during the epidemic progression is called $R(t)$, a time-varying reproduction number. Finally exist also the effective reproduction number, describes the average number of secondary infected people during the epidemic (rescaling the value with the true number of susceptible). 


\subsubsection{Incubation period and serial interval} The incubation is the time after exposure in which the disease develops and ends when the infected start to show symptoms. The serial interval is instead the time that exists between two transmissions in a chain of infections.

Dato l'approccio multidisciplinare sarebbe interessante inserire anche qualche termine per fare vedere che ho approondito anche questo aspetto. 

\section{Epidemiological models categorization}
Starting from the observation of the real world, the desire to understand better a certain phenomenon is the fundament of mathematical model development. A perfect model does not exist, because it is based on data or on assumptions that are incomplete w.r.t reality. However, a useful model guarantees the possibility of realizing general predictions and can be a powerful instrument for policymakers.  For example, an application is the estimation of certain policies' effects on the population during an epidemic. So, the aim is to have meaningful results, under a given set of real-world circumstances.
When working on a model the importance of the uncertainty related to claims realized with this instrument must always remembered. This concept is remarked also on the definition of mathematical model present in \cite{Ledder_2023}. 
\begin{displayquote}
	"A Mathematical model is a self-contained collection of one or more variables together with a set of rules (usually formulas and equations) that prescribe the values of those variables. Models serve as an approximate quantitative description of some actual or hypothetical real-world scenario. They are created in the hope that the behavior they predict will capture enough of the features of that scenario to be useful."
\end{displayquote}

There are several different typologies of mathematical models developed.
A first classification can be done considering the method used to obtain them: mechanistic, empirical, or conceptual models.
The mechanistic model is based on assumptions about reality, or theoretical principles, modeled using a collection of one or more variables together with a self-contained set of rules. These models have an explanatory value on the reality they represent.
Empirical models are realized by fitting a set of data. It is a powerful instrument, because data can be modeled quite well, but they lack the explanatory value of the mechanistic model.  Finally, with conceptual model, it is meant a verbal description of a real-world scenario. 

For the present work, the mechanistic model is the strategy used.  This is because, in the epidemiology field, the scopes that conduce to the realization of a model go beyond just fitting data. Examples of possible scopes are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item following the epidemic evolution
	\item collect and realize a structure to understand the information related to the disease 
	\item obtaining general insight about control strategies
	\item realize predictions
\end{itemize}
Considering the mechanistic category several different types of models have been developed or are adapted to be used in epidemiology modeling. In this section, the principal typologies are now introduced. 

 There is then a focus, in \ref{subsec:SIR}, because it represents the mathematical base model of the multi-layer system implemented in the present work. It is important to introduce the logic underlying its structure, its main mechanisms, and the first important conclusion that can be derived from it because it is a useful introduction to the approach that will later be employed in the rest of the thesis.

\subsection{Mean field models}

The mean field model, also known as compartmental model is the first developed and most studied type of mathematical model used in epidemiology.  This model assumes that the well-mixed population is divided into several subgroups. Each compartment is a different stage of the disease under consideration. Some possible states are susceptibles, asymptomatic (infected), symptomatic (infected), infected, exposed, vaccinated, quarantined, dead, recovered, and hospitalized. The classes considered in the realized model determine is base structure. The choice to include a certain compartment depends on the disease that is modeled and on the assumptions that are under analysis. Different models can be suitable to analyze the same disease but can be used with different aims. The difference is that a more complex model can emphasize some aspects or effects of the disease, that are not highlighted by a simpler one. 
In this class of model, the severity of infection usually is not considered: people are infected or not. The transition from one compartment to another is determined by differential equations. There are parameters ruling the transition between groups that are coefficients whose meaning depends on the model's underlying assumptions. The most important metric in this class of models is the so-called "basic reproduction number". It expresses the seriousness of a disease and it is considered the fundamental threshold in epidemiology \cite{Hernandez_Vargas_2022}. 

\subsubsection{SIR model}
\label{subsec:SIR}
The model that represents the base for epidemic mathematical studying is the SIR.  Here the population or density of individuals is divided into three groups: Susceptible, Infectious, and Recovered. At time $t$ the three groups are identified with the symbols: $S(t)$, $I(t)$, and $R(t)$. 
The symbols used to indicate the density of each group are $s$, $i$, and $r$, while the capital letters are used to specify both the name of the groups or the absolute number of participants in each one. 
Usually, the assumption that N remains stable is made. This is possible considering that the term epidemic identifies a disease with a duration much lower than the life of a person. Considering this assumption the number of deaths and births can be neglected. Alternatively, we can consider that the number of births, which is an influx in the S compartment is roughly equal to the number of deaths, which is an outflux. These statements imply $s(t) + i(t) + r(t)= 1$ and $\dot{s}+ \dot{i} + \dot{r}= 0$.
The disease reproduces horizontal incidence within the population. So, it is the connection with others that causes the infection diffusion. 
$\beta$ is a coefficient that expresses the number of adequate contacts on average of a person per unit of time. The simplest way to explain the meaning of $\beta$ is to consider that not every contact between a susceptible and an infected person can generate a contagion. The formula  $\beta \frac{I}{N} = \beta i$ is then the average number of contacts with infectives per unit time of one susceptible. Finally, the number of new cases per unit of time due to the $S = N s$  susceptibles is $\beta \frac{I}{N} S = \beta N i s$. This form of horizontal incidence is called the standard
incidence. In this incidence, there is no dependence on population size \cite{Hethcote_2000}. This is because the contact of individuals daily is independent of the country dimension in which they live. 

The second transition process in the model is that individuals move from the infectious state to the recovered one at a rate $\gamma$. So the infection duration lasts an average time of $1/\gamma$ days. The $\gamma$ parameter represents the healing or recovery rate of the population. A mathematical interpretation of this term is that  
corresponds to exponentially distributed waiting times in the $I$ compartments. The transfer rate $\gamma I$ corresponds to $P(t) = e^{\gamma t}$. It is the fraction of infected that are still in their class after time $t$ of entering it and with a mean waiting time of $\frac{1}{\gamma}$.


%%
In this initial model, the immunity acquired after recovering from the illness is lifelong. It is equivalent if after being sick a person recovers or dies because it is considered that it will not transmit the infection anymore.  This assumption can be modified and there are often diseases in which after a certain period individuals become again susceptible. Another initial simplification is the one of considers the coefficient $\beta$ and $\gamma$ constant. 

Although the SIR model is quite simple it can predict a very important aspect of an epidemic, the threshold value. This effect was the main novelty studied in the pioneering work of Kermack and McKendrick \cite{kermack1927}. They found that in a fully susceptible population if and only if R0 > 1 an infection can start diffusing. Thus the origin of the term "threshold value" in epidemiology. 

The dynamic of this system has been extensively studied and analyzed during the years CITA. The threshold effect distinguishes between two scenarios. The first is when $R_0 <1 $. It is called "free disease equilibrium. 
In a fully susceptible population, a disease with a $R_0$ less than one does not spread. The initial small number of infected tends to zero and at equilibrium the whole population has remained in the $S$ group. This state, as proved in \cite{Hernandez_Vargas_2022}, is globally asymptotically stable. The second case is when the threshold is larger than one. Here, the number of infected grows until a peak and then decreases to zero. Both this max value of infected and the final number of susceptible can be calculated knowing the system's initial condition ($s_0$ and $i_0$) and the value of $\beta$ and $\gamma$, as explained in \cite{Hethcote_2000}. 
This second scenario analyzed with a simple SIR model permits us to immediately understand how a very aggressive infection can spread across a large part of a population. In this situation, if no countermeasures are taken in time, there can be severe consequences on the society, with social and economic damages. 

\subsubsection{Derivation of I evolution and SIR differential equations presentation}
After having theoretically presented the model, it is now explained one method to derive the mathematical form of the infection compartment evolution. 
The set of differential equations that  describe the dynamic of infection is the following:
\begin{equation}
	\begin{cases}
		dS(t) / dt = -\beta S(t) I(t)\\
		dI(t) / dt = \beta S(t) I(t) - \gamma I(t)\\
		dR(t) / dt =  \gamma I(t)
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
Here $X(t)$ is indicated as the population at time $t$ in the X compartment. Remember that the assumption of constant population size is also done, so $S(t)+I(t)+R(t) = N$ holds.

The number of infected, with an interval  $\Delta t$, that in a base case can coincide with one day, is given by the equation:
\begin{equation}
	I(t+\Delta t) = I(t) + [\beta S(t)I(t)/N - \gamma I(t)]\Delta t
\end{equation}

If the value of N is large, the variables can be considered as continuous, and imposing a time interval close to zero it becomes:

\begin{equation}
	\frac{d I(t)}{dt} = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow  0} \frac{I(t+\Delta t)-I(t)}{\Delta t} = \beta S(t) I(t)- \gamma I(t)
\end{equation}

Consider now the initial state of the system. At the beginning of the disease, considering that there are few infected, the majority of the population is in the susceptible groups, so $S(0) \approx N$. Furthermore, during the initial days of contagion diffusion, this quantity remains stable. Considering this approximation, we have 
\begin{equation}
	\frac{d I(t)}{dt} = (\beta S(0)-\gamma)I(t),
\end{equation} 
which gives now a differential equation with only a variable, $I(t)$, that has a well-known solution:

\begin{equation}
	I(t) = I(0) \exp ^{(\beta S(0)- \gamma)t}
	\label{eqn:sol_I}
\end{equation}



From the analytic solution of the infectious dynamic equation in \ref{eqn:sol_I}, we can see what happens at the beginning of an epidemic.  If the exponential argument has a positive sign it is observed an exponential increase in the number of infected. While, in the opposite case, infected people tend to zero. 
The value $\frac{ \beta}{\gamma} S(0) = 1$ is defined as the epidemic threshold. In the initial phase of the epidemic the relation $\frac{ \beta}{\gamma} S(0) = \frac{ \beta}{\gamma} N $  holds. 
This quantity, normalized, is called the basic reproductive rate, and indicated with the symbol $R_0$.

It measures the intensity of the contagion or the number of secondary infections a sick person can generate. Analysing the equation of susceptibles, with this model we see that it is always decreasing. In the SIR model, if the condition to start the epidemic is satisfied after an increase in the number of Infected, there is a point at which $\frac { \beta}{\gamma} S(0)$ becomes less than one. It is when this happens that the peak of the $I(t)$ curve is reached. Then, the disease begins its falling phase. It is the natural behavior of an epidemic.

In b) are presented different evolutions of the disease varying only the $\beta$ coefficient. The smaller its value the flattened and the more delayed the infectious curve is.}
	\label{fig:sir_example}
\end{figure}
Other two interesting quantities to consider when a new disease appears are the rate of increase of the infectious and the final size of remaining susceptible at the end of the epidemic. There is a large difference when a population suffers from an epidemic if this ends rapidly because a lot of people get sick or if this number can be controlled, and the infectious curve is flatter. A strategy to flatten the curve can reduce the contact between susceptibles, actuating social distancing or avoiding contact with infected, implementing quarantine measures. These are two simple examples of actions that reduce the value of $\beta$. Another countermeasure is represented by vaccination. Its immediate effect on the epidemic is to remove susceptibles people, so the disease can afflict only a small group and be quickly extinguished. 

\subsubsection{Stochastic models} 	
This is a group of models deriving by the mean-field, but using a different mathematical approach.
In this typology, the transition from one state to another is determined using a function of probability.  Conceptually are derived using the same framework used with ODE models. They are useful when the disease to study has a lower number of infected or if there is a connection between the epidemic outcome and changes in individual dynamics. This is called demographic variability, and it concerns changes in transmission, births, recovery, or deaths within the population. Using stochastic models with Monte Carlo simulations can be useful to investigate epidemic models on networks \cite{Allen2017}. 
The two most important types of models using this approach consider the time variable as continuous, $t \in [0, \infty) $and then the state variable is either discrete (Continuous-Time Markov-Chain) or continuous (Stochastic Differential Equations).
Referring to the SIR model to make a simple example here the S and I compartments are modeled as random variables. The probability of individuals changing groups depends on infection and recovery, the possible events that can occur. It is called transition probability. 
In a Markov chain approach the transition probability is discretized, and there is no dependence on the history of the epidemic to know how it will evolve at time $t + \Delta t$. It is necessary to know only the current state of the process at time $t$. 
In the Stochastic differential equation, the random variables are continuous. 

\subsection{Agent-based networks}

Agent-based models are an alternative technique used to represent disease evolution. This approach is implemented based on the observation of spontaneous connections made by individuals. The evolution of a disease is considered over complex and realistic networks. The focus of this type of model is to understand how the network structure influences the epidemic by observing parameters such as the rate of spread.

In this framework, the nodes of the graph represent individuals (with all the properties that the modeler deems relevant for the study), while the edges represent interactions between people. Nodes can also represent subgroups of people, and using weights on edges makes it possible to characterize the strength of these interactions.

An advantage of this type of model is that it offers a very intuitive approach to epidemic modeling. Using an individual perspective guarantees an immediate interpretation of the model. A precise agent-based model can provide a greater understanding of the illness under consideration and direct information about countermeasures to implement to stop or mitigate its spread. However, to be powerful and capable of performing good analyses and predictions, a lot of information must be integrated into the model. Only if the agent-based model is highly capable of realistically reconstructing a real network can it be a reliable instrument, and achieving this requires very complex work.

%%

An example of a possible mathematical implementation of this class of models is now briefly presented. One possible technique to describe peer-to-peer contact in a graph structure is realized through a probabilistic framework. Here, assuming a total of $n$ agents in the model, spread processes can be described as a function of probability. Using Markov processes, each agent has a certain probability of transitioning from one state of the disease to another. To calculate the value of these probabilities, both the information derived from the network structure and parameters related to the disease, such as infectivity and recovery rates, are used. In this way, a stochastic evolution model of the processes is developed.

Considering an SIS model described with a Markov process: it has a dimension of $2^n$, while implementing an SIRS model requires a dimension of $3^n$. Because the size of models developed in this manner becomes rapidly enormous, a mean-field approximation is employed. It is based on the assumptions of a network composed of a sufficiently large number of agents and on the independence of these nodes. With this technique, by taking expectations, the transition rates of individuals are approximated. Using these approximations, the boundary values of the agent's probability of infection can be determined at each time step \cite{Hernandez_Vargas_2022}.
