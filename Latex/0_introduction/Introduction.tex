\chapter{Introduction}

What has been one of the main dangers humanity has faced throughout its history? The first answers that can be given are war or climate change, but there is another great threat that has severely affected the lives of almost all the population on earth: disease and epidemic. There is not a period neither nowadays nor in the past in which illness has not influenced our lives. 

Looking to the past the consequences of the epidemic on the population were worse than today because of the lack of knowledge about medical science and the poor hygienic conditions.  During the bubonic plague of the 14th century, for example, 25 million deaths were reported in Europe out of a population of 100 million. Jews were considered responsible for the illness spread and they began to be persecuted.
Otherwise, in the course of the Americas' colonization, the disease imported by the Europeans was one of the main causes of the genocide of the local population, causing their defeat against the Spanish conquistadores. In fact, diseases like smallpox and cholera were unknown in these countries and native Americans had no antibodies to contrast them. 
Other important epidemics, famous for their consequences were Spanish influenza, Smallpox, Typhus, HIV/AIDS, and the more recent Covid-19. 
It is straightforward to notice the effect that diseases have on our lives.

The development of modern medicine and hygiene can contribute to enhancing the quality of life. An example of this is that only in the last three centuries and especially in the most economical developing countries, a significant increase in life expectancy has been observed \cite{Anderson_82}.
%riscrivi meglio ma intanto ci sta. 
This increase is also happening in the poorest region, like Subsaharian Africa, and even if actually their life expctancy value is lower, newest research predict that they will have the gratest increase in the next thirty years \cite{Vollset_2024}. This study also predict that the phenomena will cause a convergence in the life expectancy between now and 2050.  

perchè succede:
"Across locations, the burden of disease will continue to shift from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional
diseases to non-communicable diseases." 
questa è la chiave e lo stesso articolo dice che  è dovuto a una diffusione sempre più permeante della sanita e di norme coadiuvate a livello di macro r egione per gestione di malattie e che questo trend va mantenuto.

 Even if mortality is decreased, the modification in social patterns and the development of large cities, have had some consequences: a higher density of population has increased in the $18^{th}$ and $19^{th}$ centuries the frequency and magnitude of epidemics.

\end{figure}


  As it can be seen in \ref{fig:worstepidemic}, even if some improvements in health status were achieved, the presence of new disease potentially escalating in an outbreak is a concrete menace that needs attention and consideration on health policies. 

However, the health status is not the only aspect concerned with a disease. Being sick causes profound modification in our relationship, work, and social life, for example, causing a deterioration of also the social health. 
There is also an economic cost associated with the cure necessary to be healed. Only in a few nations worldwide, is treatment covered free of charge by the state. In the majority, being ill can result in having to sustain high costs, causing people to go into debt or not take care. 
All these effects sum together and influence how populations behave when facing an epidemic. What are the consequences of adopting a certain behavior during a disease outbreak? It's a crucial question and can help to understand how to develop more efficient policies for contrasting epidemics. It is also the question that represents the first objective of study for the present work: can a multidisciplinary-based model be developed, integrating social and epidemiological features and analyzing their mutual relationship during a disease spread? 

Taking a step back, it's important to understand why epidemic models are crucial and what this field of research entails.
When a new disease emerges, the primary objective is to develop a defense against it. This begins with an epidemiological investigation to understand the disease's origin, the biological mechanisms behind its spread, and its resistance to existing drugs. The goal of this investigation is to gather all available information and understand the unfolding situation.
The next critical step is to study the disease's dynamics and create a model to predict its evolution. This requires understanding and estimating various parameters related to the disease. Key factors include the transmission mechanism within the population, the reproductive rate of the infectious agent in the host, the acquisition and persistence of immunity, and the contagion mechanism.
Developing a reliable model is scientifically valuable and serves as a powerful tool for stakeholders. It helps in formulating the best policies to implement during a pandemic emergency. For this purpose, theoretical epidemiology must adapt to provide insights and policy advice. Data acquisition and analysis are fundamental for statistically modeling epidemic coefficients. It is crucial to verify theoretical models against real-world data, as unverified theories cannot be validated.
In the end, a model capable of answering stakeholders' questions and making predictions, with or without the implementation of safety regulations, has numerous effects and outcomes on society. It is important to remember that, beyond the economic costs associated with every illness, there are also social costs. Developing instruments to better understand the spread of a disease can help mitigate its impact and lessen the social burden on society also preventing the loss of many lives.

	\label{fig:florentinecodexsmallpox}
\end{figure}
A first straightforward example, of the possible beneficial effects of having an epidemic model, is the possibility of arriving at the synthesis of "simple" parameters, specific for the disease under study, that can respond to questions like:
\begin{itemize}
	\item is this disease so infective that can cause a pandemic?
	\item what are the threshold conditions that can cause an outbreak? 
\end{itemize}

At first glance, the problem may appear straightforward. However, the creation of a model capable of evaluating every disease remains an unsolved challenge. Research in this field necessitates a careful balance between simplification and maintaining accuracy.

Over the past century, various aspects of epidemics have been extensively studied. Notable achievements by scientists include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Development of epidemiological models using different mathematical tools, such as differential equations and agent-based networks.
	\item Predictions about the progression of epidemics or reconstructions of the events' dynamics.
	\item Insights into epidemics, explaining phenomena like the periodicity of re-infection for certain diseases or the seasonal patterns observed in cases such as influenza.
	\item Understanding the effectiveness of specific strategies against outbreaks, such as vaccines.
\end{itemize}
Furthermore, by using multilayer networks or systems, more complex analyses can be performed. The objective is to create models capable of simulating the evolution of multiple phenomena simultaneously or to develop a more accurate representation of the real world by constructing more intricate scenarios. Examples of such models include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The simultaneous evolution of two different diseases.
	\item The formation of public opinions during an outbreak.
	\item The progression of a disease for which a vaccine exists, but where there is public fear of both the disease and potential vaccine side effects.
\end{itemize}
The work presented in this thesis is part of this type of research. A new model has been developed based on a study of existing multi-system models that integrate epidemic and behavioral or opinion components. Specifically, it is considered interesting to simulate a scenario in which the population is divided into three groups: those who have a positive opinion about the use of safety procedures and follow rules to avoid the transmission of the disease; a second group that opposes following procedures or recommendations, refusing to modify their behavior; and a third group that lacks information about the epidemic situation. This third condition represents the majority of the population when a new disease emerges, as there is limited information available and not yet widely disseminated.
In the model, the main mechanism used to change behavior among different social groups is peer pressure. The fatigue from belonging to a certain behavioral spectrum (either being compliant with the rules or against them) is also considered. An epidemiological model capable of tracking both the initial phase of an epidemic and successive waves of contagion is developed, including the possibility of reinfection.
A last feature of the work is the verification of its prediction with the use of real data. It is important for a novel multi-system model like the one implemented to have a comparison with reality. When two separate models are coupled together the result is not simply the sum of their previous characteristics, but other different phenomena can arise. Having a study, like the one performed by Meta during the Covid-19 pandemic about people's behavior is an incredible source of data that can permit us to interpret correctly the results given by the model. 
For this reason, the model's ability to reproduce what happened during the pandemic was initially tested. Then it was verified whether the peer pressure effect alone was sufficient to obtain the observed trends in population behavior or whether the addition of an external, global control factor, such as that represented by special laws implemented by governments, was necessary.

The main result achieved is that the model is functional and demonstrates reliability when compared with COVID-19 data. The study highlights the crucial importance of respecting quarantine measures and avoiding contact when infected, as these actions can significantly reduce the model's reproduction number, thereby limiting the spread of the disease. Altri risultati arriveranno concludendo la tesi.

\chapter{Main objectives and summary of the contents}

In this chapter, the main objectives pursued with the current work are presented and it is described the composition of the thesis. 
Starting from an analysis of the theoretical contributions already developed for epidemiology, and in particular focusing on multilayer systems and mean-field models, the following questions are studied:

\begin{itemize}
	\item how can be modeled in an effective way population behavior? What are the characteristics that must be considered?
	\item Can people's behavior influence the development of an epidemic?
	\item Is it sufficient to stop an outbreak by relying on the natural subdivision of the population into compliant and non-compliant groups regarding safety measures, or is the intervention of a central "controller" necessary to set new behavior rules?
	\item What is the most efficient way to model population collective consciousness about the epidemic's development? 
\end{itemize}
About the last question, consciousness or awareness is a parameter considered useful to gain insight into society's reaction to the disease. Furthermore, there can be differences in behavior when the same conditions occur at different times, such as at the beginning of an outbreak versus several months later. The quantity and quality of information available to the population can make a difference in how deal with difficult situations.

Starting from these questions, the following objectives have been identified:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Create an original epidemic-behavioral multi-system model capable of tracking the development of a disease and representing behavior modification using a peer pressure mechanism within the same population.
	\item Add a second control agent to the model, represented by government rules that can modify people's behavior in a centralized way.
	\item Develop a comprehensive analysis of the epidemiological and behavioral model to understand its mechanisms and correctly interpret the mutual effects arising from the coupling of the social and health systems.
	\item Conduct a study using available data on population behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic to verify if the developed model can accurately reconstruct events and how people reacted to them.
\end{itemize}
The work consists of an introductory chapter where the main concepts of social science and epidemiology are presented. This chapter provides all the necessary information to understand the research. It includes a glossary of the most important terms and an overview of the mathematical tools used in epidemiology. Additionally, the different models implemented to simulate an epidemic are shown, with a focus on the properties of the mean fields model, which is the primary model used in the thesis. Furthermore, a historical background of the research field is provided to give a perspective on the principal milestones.
In the third chapter, a review of the literature analyzed for the thesis is presented. The articles are categorized into different main topics: epidemiology theories, opinion models, behavior models, and multi-agent and multi-system models. This subdivision highlights the most interesting aspects of each work and identifies the elements that have been considered for inclusion in the thesis.
The second part of the thesis is composed of three main chapters. In Chapter Four, the chosen epidemiological and behavioral models are simulated, and their characteristics are studied individually. Chapter Five presents the model resulting from the integration of the two, which becomes a layer of a more complex multi-system model. The main features of this model are analyzed using analytical tools. The study is performed with theoretical values, sensitivity analysis, and the measurement of principal metrics, such as the reproduction rate, to provide a general description of the model and develop an understanding of it.
In Chapter Six, the data analysis is presented. The data available from the Meta COVID-19 research are used to test and validate the model, assessing its ability to represent a real scenario. Finally, the last chapter contains the conclusions of the thesis.

\chapter{Theoretical background}

\section{Epidemiological theory foundations}

Having a clear description of the main concepts in social science and epidemiology is essential for understanding the rest of the work developed. In the first section of the introduction, the theoretical basis and main concepts that will be used in the present work are defined. First, a brief historical review of the milestones in the field of epidemiology is provided, followed by a glossary of the main terms used in this thesis. Finally, the most commonly used mathematical tools are presented.
\subsection{ Epidemiologic research historical background}

The research field regarding the development of technique to understand how epidemics can evolve during time has a history starting back in the 20th century. The first important discovery in this field must be attributed to the scientists that find the mechanism used by disease to spread. 
A first innovative work is the one done by John Snow, that during an epidemic of Cholera in London in 1854 successfully determined the source of the infection, even without knowing its etiological agent. Then advancing in the microbiological research is conducted by Pasteur and Koch. They found the etiological agent of disease, enabling the possibility to treat and prevent people from an infection. 
Then, Hamer work in 1906 added a first major theoretical contribution. He formulated a theory about the correlation between the course of an epidemic and the interaction, contact ratio, between susceptible and infectious individuals. It is the so called “mass -action” principle. The number of contacts between these two groups determines the spread rate of the disease. 
This law originally written in discrete time, is then updated in 1908 by Ross, that re-written it  in continuous time. For the first time the problem can be studied using a clearly, well defined mathematical theory. Then the contributions of Kermack and McKendrick in 1927 add another fundamental principle to the modern epidemiology. They formulated a threshold theory explaining which condition can generate the development of an epidemic. The theorem affirms that a certain value must be exceed, depending on the proportion of susceptible and infectious individual. Controlling this value permits to understand if the number of infections will increase, until a peak is reached or if the epidemic is a descendent phase \cite{Mata2021}, \cite{Anderson_82}. 
Their contribution with the mass action principle represents the base for the mean field model theory, that will be presented and analysed in section \ref{subsec:SIR}. 



\subsection{Epidemiological glossary}
To permit a better comprehension of the subject analyzed in the present work a list of principal concepts and terms is presented.

\subsubsection{Micro and Macro parasite}
	The first difference when presenting infection is distinguishing the type of origin that can cause it. An etiological organism responsible for a disease can be divided into microparasite and macroparasite. The former live and reproduce within the host, generating an immune response and the infections caused by them usually have two possible outcomes: death or immunity. Infections origins from them are shorter than the life span of an individual, and so have a transient nature.
\subsubsection{Types of infectious diseases}
Infectious disease is indicated as an illness resulting from the presence of a pathogenic microbial agent. It is possible to distinguish a difference between \textit{transmittable} and \textit{communicable} disease. A transmittable disease can transmitted between persons through unnatural forces. A disease is communicable when the transmission happens directly or indirectly.

\subsubsection{Disease transmission} A disease can spread in different ways: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item person to person, for example sexual transmission, involving direct or indirect contact.
		\item airborne, through inhalation of infected air.
		\item food or water borne, ingesting contaminated food. 
		\item vector born, the contagion is caused by infected animals.
	\end{itemize}
	Furthermore when the diffusion is among the same generations is called horizontal transmission, while vertical transmission is the one developing between different generations, from parents to children. 
	Zoonosis is the phenomenon in which a disease that starts in an animal species mutates and attacks humans. The opposite can also happen and it is called inverse-zoonosis. 
	
\subsubsection{Epidemic disease} It occurs when there is a disease with a rapid outbreak, in less than a year there is its development and a peak is reached. The illness is confined to a limited region

\subsubsection{Endemic disease} It is a disease that lasts for a long time and requires consideration of its impact on population renewal and in the number of susceptible individuals.

\subsubsection{Pandemic disease} It is an epidemic that diffuses across multiple regions, on a global scale. The severity of the disease also makes a distinction in calling a disease a pandemic. For example, a common cold is diffused in the whole world but is not defined as a pandemic by the WHO (World Health Organization). 

\subsubsection{Incubation, Symptoms, Infected and Infectious}   A person having contact with another infectious individual, can or not become infected. The incubation is the period after being infected in which the infection increases in size or number in the host but does not produce the symptoms, that are the effect of the disease. 

\subsubsection{Outbreak} Is the rapid raise in the number of infected during an epidemic.

\subsubsection{Incidence and prevalence} The first term refers to the number of new cases after a certain period (daily or weekly for example), while prevalence is the proportion of the population affected by a disease in a specific time.

\subsubsection{Immunity and herd immunity} Immunity is protection from a disease gained after having contracted it. It can last forever or vanish after a certain time. New exposure to the virus does not lead to infection. Herd immunity is instead an important phenomenon in which the defense against a disease is due to the majority of the population being immune, thanks to vaccines or surviving it. This majority protects the rest of the population because slows down the diffusion or stops the spread of the illness.

\subsubsection{Virulence and Contagiousness}  Virulence is used to describe how aggressive, harmful, and pathogenic is a biological agent in attacking cells. Contagiousness is referred to an individual and it is used to represent the capability to transmit a disease. 

\subsubsection{Overdispersion and Superspreading} Overdispersion is a term that refers to observing a larger variance than expected from a normal distribution. It is used in statistics to measure superspreading, a circumstance in which there is an anomaly (higher) number of secondary infections.

\subsubsection{CFR, IFR and mortality excess} The case fatality rate is the ratio between the number of deaths due to a specific disease and the total number of confirmed positive cases. It is the likelihood for an infected person to die because of the infection. The infection fatality rate is instead the percentage of people infected with the disease that are expected to die. The two quantities can have a similar value: if every person who contracts the disease and every death attributable to the disease is known and recorded, then the CFR will equal the IFR.
The excess in mortality can be calculated by observing the difference between the total death rate (due to any reason) a month per month in a comparison between a year with an epidemic and one without. 

\subsubsection{Reproduction number $R_0$} It is the fundamental measure of the infectiousness of a disease. It is the average number of secondary infections caused by one infected person in a fully susceptible population. If it is recalculated during the epidemic progression is called $R(t)$, a time-varying reproduction number. Finally exist also the effective reproduction number, describes the average number of secondary infected people during the epidemic (rescaling the value with the true number of susceptible). 


\subsubsection{Incubation period and serial interval} The incubation is the time after exposure in which the disease develops and ends when the infected start to show symptoms. The serial interval is instead the time that exists between two transmissions in a chain of infections. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Opinion/behaviour glossary}
To establish a framework suitable for developing and understanding behavioral models, the following key concepts from social science are outlined.
\subsubsection{Awareness} It is the knowledge that an individual has on a certain subject or situation. It changes with time and it is developed with information or experience.  
\subsubsection{Information} The term "information" is often understood as "knowledge communicated." However, due to its central role in contemporary society, there is extensive debate regarding its multiple meanings \cite{Capurro_2003}. Our society can be characterized as an "information society," where the development of information technology has influenced all aspects of life. Currently, the word "information" is associated with two principal meanings. The first, more universal definition, is that information is anything important in answering a question. The second relates to Information Science, the discipline focused on managing this object called information in any form.
\subsubsection{Belief} It is the conviction of the truth of a statement or the reality of a being or phenomenon, especially when based on the examination of evidence, but also on matters for which there is no proof.

Studying beliefs change over time and on social networks is an interesting research field. It has the aim to understand why in certain societies new beliefs - such as opinions on climate change or anti-vaccinism spread more quickly than in others. These dynamics can lead to polarization or consensus and occasionally cause backlash effects.

\subsubsection{Behaviour} It is how one acts or conducts oneself. It can depend on the response of external stimuli and have effects, especially on others.
\subsubsection{Trust} It is the sentiment of confidence associated with the ability, strength, and truth of someone or something. 

\subsubsection{Perception} It is the mechanism for which something is regarded, understood, or interpreted.

\subsubsection{Group decision-making} It is a phenomenon at the intersection of psychology, management, biology, and applied mathematics studying how people in groups interact, exchange information, and realize decisions. The decision made by the group is no longer attributable to any single individual but to the whole group. 
 
\subsubsection{Threshold theory}

It is a theory formulated by Granovetter in \cite{Granovetter_1978} regarding collective behavior. The theory posits that in a society where individuals face two possible alternatives, and their choices involve certain costs and benefits depending on how many others choose each alternative, an individual will decide based on the number of others who have already chosen a particular option when this number exceeds a certain threshold.

\subsubsection{Polarization and Consensus}

Polarization refers to the variation in beliefs within a population.There are multiple meanings that can be associated to this term. One way to describe it is by measuring the distance between the most extreme beliefs, their spread or at the distribution of opinions in a certain interval. 

 The use of groups, identifying different concentration can be useful to explain the polarization phenomenon. Groups can be "exogenously" defined where are identified by characterstic like regionality, ethnicity, sex, education level, or other cathegories. To describe correctly the polarization a clear definition of the groups in consideration is necessary. 
 A first polarization group based is community fracturing, where the population is divided into subgroups\cite{Bramson_2017} .
 
 This contrasts with the term "consensus," which describes a situation where the exchange of opinions, information, or property among individuals leads to general agreement. Both scenarios are studied and modeled using network theory.

\subsubsection{Homophily} The tendency to bond and associate with similar others. 

\section{Epidemiological models categorization}
Starting from the observation of the real world, the desire to understand better a certain phenomenon is the fundament of mathematical model development. A perfect model does not exist, because it is based on data or on assumptions that are incomplete w.r.t reality. However, a useful model guarantees the possibility of realizing general predictions and can be a powerful instrument for policymakers.  For example, an application is the estimation of certain policies' effects on the population during an epidemic. So, the aim is to have meaningful results, under a given set of real-world circumstances.
When working on a model the importance of the uncertainty related to claims realized with this instrument must always remembered. This concept is remarked also on the definition of mathematical model present in \cite{Ledder_2023}. 
\begin{displayquote}
	"A Mathematical model is a self-contained collection of one or more variables together with a set of rules (usually formulas and equations) that prescribe the values of those variables. Models serve as an approximate quantitative description of some actual or hypothetical real-world scenario. They are created in the hope that the behavior they predict will capture enough of the features of that scenario to be useful."
\end{displayquote}

There are several different typologies of mathematical models developed.
A first classification can be done considering the method used to obtain them: mechanistic, empirical, or conceptual models.
The mechanistic model is based on assumptions about reality, or theoretical principles, modeled using a collection of one or more variables together with a self-contained set of rules. These models have an explanatory value on the reality they represent.
Empirical models are realized by fitting a set of data. It is a powerful instrument, because data can be modeled quite well, but they lack the explanatory value of the mechanistic model.  Finally, with conceptual model, it is meant a verbal description of a real-world scenario. 

For the present work, the mechanistic model is the strategy used.  This is because, in the epidemiology field, the scopes that conduce to the realization of a model go beyond just fitting data. Examples of possible scopes are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item following the epidemic evolution
	\item collect and realize a structure to understand the information related to the disease 
	\item obtaining general insight about control strategies
	\item realize predictions
\end{itemize}
Considering the mechanistic category several different types of models have been developed or are adapted to be used in epidemiology modeling. In this section, the principal typologies are now introduced. 

 There is then a focus, in \ref{subsec:SIR}, because it represents the mathematical base model of the multi-layer system implemented in the present work. It is important to introduce the logic underlying its structure, its main mechanisms, and the first important conclusion that can be derived from it because it is a useful introduction to the approach that will later be employed in the rest of the thesis.

\subsection{Mean field models}
\label{subsec:mean_field}
The mean field model, also known as compartmental model is the first developed and most studied type of mathematical model used in epidemiology \cite{kermack1927}, \cite{brauer2012mathematical}, \cite{Anderson_82}, and \cite{anderson1991infectious}.  This model assumes that the well-mixed population is divided into several subgroups. Each compartment is a different stage of the disease under consideration. Some possible states are susceptibles, asymptomatic (infected), symptomatic (infected), infected, exposed, vaccinated, quarantined, dead, recovered, and hospitalized. The classes considered in the realized model determine is base structure. The choice to include a certain compartment depends on the disease that is modeled and on the assumptions that are under analysis. Different models can be suitable to analyze the same disease but can be used with different aims. The difference is that a more complex model can emphasize some aspects or effects of the disease, that are not highlighted by a simpler one. 
In this class of model, the severity of infection usually is not considered: people are infected or not. The transition from one compartment to another is determined by differential equations. There are parameters ruling the transition between groups that are coefficients whose meaning depends on the model's underlying assumptions. The most important metric in this class of models is the so-called "basic reproduction number". It expresses the seriousness of a disease and it is considered the fundamental threshold in epidemiology \cite{Hernandez_Vargas_2022}. 
\begin{figure}[]

	\caption[SIRS example]{An example of the graph structure of a mean field SIRS model. There are three compartments and the flow rate between them is ruled by the coefficients $\beta$, $\gamma$ and $\delta$.}
	\label{fig:sirsfigurecompartmental}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{SIR model}
\label{subsec:SIR}
The model that represents the base for epidemic mathematical studying is the SIR.  Here the population or density of individuals is divided into three groups: Susceptible, Infectious, and Recovered. At time $t$ the three groups are identified with the symbols: $S(t)$, $I(t)$, and $R(t)$. 
The symbols used to indicate the density of each group are $s$, $i$, and $r$, while the capital letters are used to specify both the name of the groups or the absolute number of participants in each one. 
Usually, the assumption that N remains stable is made. This is possible considering that the term epidemic identifies a disease with a duration much lower than the life of a person. Considering this assumption the number of deaths and births can be neglected. Alternatively, we can consider that the number of births, which is an influx in the S compartment is roughly equal to the number of deaths, which is an outflux. These statements imply $s(t) + i(t) + r(t)= 1$ and $\dot{s}+ \dot{i} + \dot{r}= 0$.
The disease reproduces horizontal incidence within the population. So, it is the connection with others that causes the infection diffusion. 
$\beta$ is a coefficient that expresses the number of adequate contacts on average of a person per unit of time. The simplest way to explain the meaning of $\beta$ is to consider that not every contact between a susceptible and an infected person can generate a contagion. The formula  $\beta \frac{I}{N} = \beta i$ is then the average number of contacts with infectives per unit time of one susceptible. Finally, the number of new cases per unit of time due to the $S = N s$  susceptibles is $\beta \frac{I}{N} S = \beta N i s$. This form of horizontal incidence is called the standard
incidence. In this incidence, there is no dependence on population size \cite{Hethcote_2000}. This is because the contact of individuals daily is independent of the country dimension in which they live. 

The second transition process in the model is that individuals move from the infectious state to the recovered one at a rate $\gamma$. So the infection duration lasts an average time of $1/\gamma$ days. The $\gamma$ parameter represents the healing or recovery rate of the population. A mathematical interpretation of this term is that  
corresponds to exponentially distributed waiting times in the $I$ compartments. The transfer rate $\gamma I$ corresponds to $P(t) = e^{\gamma t}$. It is the fraction of infected that are still in their class after time $t$ of entering it and with a mean waiting time of $\frac{1}{\gamma}$.


%%
In this initial model, the immunity acquired after recovering from the illness is lifelong. It is equivalent if after being sick a person recovers or dies because it is considered that it will not transmit the infection anymore.  This assumption can be modified and there are often diseases in which after a certain period individuals become again susceptible. Another initial simplification is the one of considers the coefficient $\beta$ and $\gamma$ constant. 

Although the SIR model is quite simple it can predict a very important aspect of an epidemic, the threshold value. This effect was the main novelty studied in the pioneering work of Kermack and McKendrick \cite{kermack1927}. They found that in a fully susceptible population if and only if R0 > 1 an infection can start diffusing. Thus the origin of the term "threshold value" in epidemiology. 

The dynamic of this system has been extensively studied and analyzed during the years \cite{Breda_2012}, \cite{akinboro2014numerical}, \cite{Jard_n_Kojakhmetov_2021}, \cite{Ledder_2023}, \cite{Okabe_2020}, \cite{Prodanov_2022}, \cite{Xu_2014}, and \cite{Turkyilmazoglu_2021}. The threshold effect distinguishes between two scenarios. The first is when $R_0 <1 $. It is called "free disease equilibrium. 
In a fully susceptible population, a disease with a $R_0$ less than one does not spread. The initial small number of infected tends to zero and at equilibrium the whole population has remained in the $S$ group. This state, as proved in \cite{Hernandez_Vargas_2022}, is globally asymptotically stable. The second case is when the threshold is larger than one. Here, the number of infected grows until a peak and then decreases to zero. Both this max value of infected and the final number of susceptible can be calculated knowing the system's initial condition ($s_0$ and $i_0$) and the value of $\beta$ and $\gamma$, as explained in \cite{Hethcote_2000}. 
This second scenario analyzed with a simple SIR model permits us to immediately understand how a very aggressive infection can spread across a large part of a population. In this situation, if no countermeasures are taken in time, there can be severe consequences on the society, with social and economic damages. 

\subsubsection{Derivation of I evolution and SIR differential equations presentation}
After having theoretically presented the model, it is now explained one method to derive the mathematical form of the infection compartment evolution. 
The set of differential equations that  describe the dynamic of infection is the following:
\begin{equation}
	\begin{cases}
		dS(t) / dt = -\beta S(t) I(t)\\
		dI(t) / dt = \beta S(t) I(t) - \gamma I(t)\\
		dR(t) / dt =  \gamma I(t)
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
Here $X(t)$ is indicated as the population at time $t$ in the X compartment. Remember that the assumption of constant population size is also done, so $S(t)+I(t)+R(t) = N$ holds.

The number of infected, with an interval  $\Delta t$, that in a base case can coincide with one day, is given by the equation:
\begin{equation}
	I(t+\Delta t) = I(t) + [\beta S(t)I(t)/N - \gamma I(t)]\Delta t
\end{equation}

If the value of N is large, the variables can be considered as continuous, and imposing a time interval close to zero it becomes:

\begin{equation}
	\frac{d I(t)}{dt} = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow  0} \frac{I(t+\Delta t)-I(t)}{\Delta t} = \beta S(t) I(t)- \gamma I(t)
\end{equation}

Consider now the initial state of the system. At the beginning of the disease, considering that there are few infected, the majority of the population is in the susceptible groups, so $S(0) \approx N$. Furthermore, during the initial days of contagion diffusion, this quantity remains stable. Considering this approximation, we have 
\begin{equation}
	\frac{d I(t)}{dt} = (\beta S(0)-\gamma)I(t),
\end{equation} 
which gives now a differential equation with only a variable, $I(t)$, that has a well-known solution:

\begin{equation}
	I(t) = I(0) \exp ^{(\beta S(0)- \gamma)t}
	\label{eqn:sol_I}
\end{equation}



From the analytic solution of the infectious dynamic equation in \ref{eqn:sol_I}, we can see what happens at the beginning of an epidemic.  If the exponential argument has a positive sign it is observed an exponential increase in the number of infected. While, in the opposite case, infected people tend to zero. 
The value $\frac{ \beta}{\gamma} S(0) = 1$ is defined as the epidemic threshold. In the initial phase of the epidemic the relation $\frac{ \beta}{\gamma} S(0) = \frac{ \beta}{\gamma} N $  holds. 
This quantity, normalized, is called the basic reproductive rate, and indicated with the symbol $R_0$.

It measures the intensity of the contagion or the number of secondary infections a sick person can generate. Analysing the equation of susceptibles, with this model we see that it is always decreasing. In the SIR model, if the condition to start the epidemic is satisfied after an increase in the number of Infected, there is a point at which $\frac { \beta}{\gamma} S(0)$ becomes less than one. It is when this happens that the peak of the $I(t)$ curve is reached. Then, the disease begins its falling phase. It is the natural behavior of an epidemic.

In b) are presented different evolutions of the disease varying only the $\beta$ coefficient. The smaller its value the flattened and the more delayed the infectious curve is.}
	\label{fig:sir_example}
\end{figure}
Other two interesting quantities to consider when a new disease appears are the rate of increase of the infectious and the final size of remaining susceptible at the end of the epidemic. There is a large difference when a population suffers from an epidemic if this ends rapidly because a lot of people get sick or if this number can be controlled, and the infectious curve is flatter. A strategy to flatten the curve can reduce the contact between susceptibles, actuating social distancing or avoiding contact with infected, implementing quarantine measures. These are two simple examples of actions that reduce the value of $\beta$. Another countermeasure is represented by vaccination. Its immediate effect on the epidemic is to remove susceptibles people, so the disease can afflict only a small group and be quickly extinguished. 

\subsubsection{Stochastic models} 	
This is a group of models deriving by the mean-field, but using a different mathematical approach.
In this typology, the transition from one state to another is determined using a function of probability.  Conceptually are derived using the same framework used with ODE models. They are useful when the disease to study has a lower number of infected or if there is a connection between the epidemic outcome and changes in individual dynamics. This is called demographic variability, and it concerns changes in transmission, births, recovery, or deaths within the population. Using stochastic models with Monte Carlo simulations can be useful to investigate epidemic models on networks \cite{Allen2017}. 
The two most important types of models using this approach consider the time variable as continuous, $t \in [0, \infty) $and then the state variable is either discrete (Continuous-Time Markov-Chain) or continuous (Stochastic Differential Equations).
Referring to the SIR model to make a simple example here the S and I compartments are modeled as random variables. The probability of individuals changing groups depends on infection and recovery, the possible events that can occur. It is called transition probability. 
In a Markov chain approach the transition probability is discretized, and there is no dependence on the history of the epidemic to know how it will evolve at time $t + \Delta t$. It is necessary to know only the current state of the process at time $t$. 
In the Stochastic differential equation, the random variables are continuous. 

\subsection{Networked models}
\cite{Newman2002}, \cite{VanMieghem2009}, 


\subsection{Agent-based models}

VEDI E AGGIUNGI ANCHE \cite{Tizzoni2014}

Agent-based models are an alternative technique used to represent disease evolution. This approach is implemented based on the observation of spontaneous connections made by individuals. The evolution of a disease is considered over complex and realistic networks. The focus of this type of model is to understand how the network structure influences the epidemic by observing parameters such as the rate of spread.

In this framework, the nodes of the graph represent individuals (with all the properties that the modeler deems relevant for the study), while the edges represent interactions between people. Nodes can also represent subgroups of people, and using weights on edges makes it possible to characterize the strength of these interactions.

An advantage of this type of model is that it offers a very intuitive approach to epidemic modeling. Using an individual perspective guarantees an immediate interpretation of the model. A precise agent-based model can provide a greater understanding of the illness under consideration and direct information about countermeasures to implement to stop or mitigate its spread. However, to be powerful and capable of performing good analyses and predictions, a lot of information must be integrated into the model. Only if the agent-based model is highly capable of realistically reconstructing a real network can it be a reliable instrument, and achieving this requires very complex work.

An example of a possible mathematical implementation of this class of models is now briefly presented. One possible technique to describe peer-to-peer contact in a graph structure is realized through a probabilistic framework. Here, assuming a total of $n$ agents in the model, spread processes can be described as a function of probability. Using Markov processes, each agent has a certain probability of transitioning from one state of the disease to another. To calculate the value of these probabilities, both the information derived from the network structure and parameters related to the disease, such as infectivity and recovery rates, are used. In this way, a stochastic evolution model of the processes is developed.

Considering an SIS model described with a Markov process: it has a dimension of $2^n$, while implementing an SIRS model requires a dimension of $3^n$. Because the size of models developed in this manner becomes rapidly enormous, a mean-field approximation is employed. It is based on the assumptions of a network composed of a sufficiently large number of agents and on the independence of these nodes. With this technique, by taking expectations, the transition rates of individuals are approximated. Using these approximations, the boundary values of the agent's probability of infection can be determined at each time step \cite{Hernandez_Vargas_2022}.

\subsection{Multilayer systems and networks} 

AGGIUNGI ANCHE \cite{Wang_2019}

The complex dynamic of interactions existing in the real world, develops in multiple patterns, with complicated relationships. This connection can change over time, and using the theory of multilayer systems it can improve the comprehension of such complexity. Additional information can be added to the model, for example, different types of interactions, like physical contact or information sharing, time dependency coefficients, or reliance between different parameters in nature, creating cause-effect relationships. 
It is a more recent development of the research, the traditional network theory was revisited, to create a framework that can include multiple networks, that evolve and influence each other \cite{DeDomenico2016} and can be helpful to manipulate complex systems like human relationships. Some interesting results obtained are the possibility that the onset of one disease can depend on the onset of the other one. There can be regimes in which the criticality of the two dynamics is interdependent and others in which the critical effect is only one-directional \cite{DeDomenico2016}. 
One possible way to develop models with this structure is to imagine that each layer represents a different type of interaction. An epidemiological example is a layer in which the physical contact between people is simulated and another represents social structure, the network of relations that every person has. This instrument provides a natural representation of coupled structure and dynamical processes. It has been presented in multiple works in the past years, for example in CITA. 
The dynamic realized in multiple systems can be single or coupled. In the first, there is a top layer with its dynamic evolution running on top of a multilayer network. The coupled structure instead is the one in which the phenomena described in each layer evolve with the influence of what is happening in the other. 
Multilayer networks have multiple dimensions of connectivity, called "aspects" and they have to be considered simultaneously. 
They can also be considered with two different mathematical structures. 
\begin{figure}[]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{0_introduction/images_introduction/multi_layer}
	\caption[Multi-layer network]{Representation of a multiplex structure. The figure is taken by the work of \cite{Granell2013} and shows the network implemented in their model. There is an awareness and an epidemic layer. In this case, the node connected with the interlayer connection represents the same individual.}
	\label{fig:multilayer}
\end{figure}

The first uses the same set of compartmental structure and mean-field models presented in the section before \ref{subsec:mean_field}. Here, from a mathematical point of view, there is no such difference in the manipulation and analysis of the system. The distinction relies on the meaning of the compartments and parameters created and on the dependence of the coefficients, which can be time and state-dependent.

The second option considers an agent-based structure. Here, considering a graph structure, composed of nodes and links between them, it is possible to classify three types of edges:
\begin{itemize}
	\item intra-layer edges, the connection of nodes on the same layer.
	\item inter-layer edges, the connection between a replica of the same node, but lying on a different layer of the structure;
	\item inter-layer edges, but coupling nodes representing distinct entities. 
\end{itemize}

A possible representation is done using a $4^{th}$ order tensor or coupling a set of adjacency matrices, called "supra-adjacency matrices". The feature that can be studied is the structural properties of the network, depending on how the various layers are coupled together. The presence of clusters or most central nodes is also important.

\chapter{Review of epidemiological behavioural and opinion models in literature}
%NUOVO TESTO
The scientific community's interest in epi-behavior models has existed for several years. Initially, as noted by \cite{Bauch_2012_overview}, the behavioral aspect of epidemiology was not given significant attention. Its development has been a gradual process, resulting from years of evolution in research.

In fact, in the initial works \cite{kermack1927}, the focus of scientists was primarily on describing the evolution of diseases. The resulting models did not account for the effect of behavior; the population was considered homogeneously mixed, leading to random contact between susceptibles and infectives \cite{Hernandez_Vargas_2022, Mata2021}. 
It was only later, as epidemiological models proved effective and reliable in describing and predicting disease spread, that interest among policymakers grew. Tools capable of integrating real data with epidemiological models emerged, aiding decision-making on matters such as the duration of school closures or travel restrictions, as described in \cite{Bauch_2012_overview}.

Furthermore, new categories of models have emerged, such as agent-based models, networked models, and multi-layer/multi-system models. Despite their differing approaches, these models aim to integrate various population characteristics—such as contact structure, age distribution, and movement patterns—to address the limitations of the original homogeneity assumption \cite{brauer2012mathematical}.
This focus on societal composition and behavior naturally stems from the desire to use modeling tools as a reference for decision-making in safety and health. 
One possible approach to incorporating changes in the structure of models that describe aspects of behavior or population composition is to do so implicitly.

In these models, the behavior of the population is implicitly considered by integrating time-variable parameters that capture changes in societal behavior. This approach represents the classical modeling technique used in the formulation of epidemiological models. Examples of studies that have utilized this methodology for analyzing COVID-19 include \cite{Giordano_2020, Dehning_2020, Proverbio_2021}.

Although models developed in this way have proven to be powerful tools for generating insights about disease dynamics and providing recommendations to policymakers, they fall short in their ability to accurately reconstruct how populations behave during an epidemic outbreak. The desire to explore this aspect and develop a framework capable of simultaneously simulating both behavior and disease diffusion—where each mutually influences the other—has driven the development of a specific research field dedicated to behavioral epidemics.

But how can behavior be integrated into pre-existing epidemiological theory? To better address this question, we follow the classification proposed in \cite{Funk_2010}, which offers a possible subdivision of behavioral literature based on the different approaches that most articles focus on. Three major categories emerge:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The source of information used to make decisions;
	\item The type of information used to make decisions;
	\item The effect of behavioral change on the dynamic described by  the model. 
\end{itemize}
When analyzing the source of information, there is a clear distinction between works that assume governments and populations base their decisions on precise data, such as the number of infected individuals (prevalence), and those that consider more informal sources, such as conversations between people, public opinion, or media representations of the situation \cite{Bulai2023}. These media sources include both traditional outlets like television and newspapers, as well as newer platforms like social networks.
This distinction highlights the diversity in how behavioral factors are integrated into models, reflecting the varying degrees of reliability and influence these sources have on decision-making processes during an epidemic.


Regarding information quality and the negative effect of misinformation spreading within the population, an example is the fear of vaccination \cite{Kahan_2013}. Several works analyze the effect that fear of vaccination has had on the spread of infection \cite{Bauch_2012_game, Epstein_2021}.
An example of how this phenomenon can arise is the story of an article originally published by a prestigious source. Even though the thesis presented in this work was later proven wrong by the scientific community \cite{wakefield1998retracted}, the negative impact in terms of spreading fear about vaccines has persisted and, in many cases, has become deeply ingrained. In this specific case, it caused a decrease in herd immunity and a resurgence of measles \cite{Bauch_2012_overview}.


After introducing the impact that information quality may have, another interesting aspect is related to the different types of information used in model development. Some articles focus on the effect of media on behavior \cite{Collinson2014, Misra_2011}, while others consider peer-to-peer conversations, information exchange, and beliefs among individuals \cite{Tyson_2020}. These are completely different approaches, even though they aim to achieve the same effect: simulating the evolution of people's opinions and behavior. Using media involves hypothesizing that the population is influenced by a few "central" information nodes, so the same news, data, or future predictions are shared with everyone. In contrast, models that use personal information exchanges can depict a scenario where many different ideas about the disease situation circulate simultaneously.
Another concept used in models that simulate a sort of "collective consciousness" is referred to as "awareness" \cite{Funk2009}. To model how awareness spreads in the population, it is often treated like a disease \cite{Silva2019, Granell_2013, Granell2014, Kabir_2019, Zuo_2021, Wang_2019}. Although there are differences, the main idea is that theories and concepts about a certain topic can spread among people, which can be considered at a higher level as a unified opinion. For example, there may be many different personal positions on how to respond to a health emergency like COVID-19, but it is possible to abstract the various opinions and reconstruct what the majority of people, or macro-groups, ultimately feel. They may either be more cooperative and in favor of following guidelines issued by authorities or more focused on their well-being and inclined to act independently.
This process can be related to opinion formation studies, which aim to understand how people form their ideas \cite{Devia_2023, Devia2022} and also analyze the possible formation of opinion distributions, such as perfect consensus, consensus, polarization, clustering, or dissensus.
