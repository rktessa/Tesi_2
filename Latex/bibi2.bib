  abstract      = {The last two years have been an extraordinary time with the Covid-19 pandemic killing millions, affecting and distressing billions of people worldwide. Authorities took various measures such as turning school and work to remote and prohibiting social relations via curfews. In order to mitigate the negative impact of the epidemics, researchers tried to estimate the future of the pandemic for different scenarios, using forecasting techniques and epidemics simulations on networks. Networks used in these research are either synthetic networks or real networks with limited size and domain specific interactions. Hence, their ability to represent the world is limited. Intending to represent real-life in an urban town in high resolution, we propose a parametric multi-layer undirected weighted network model, where vertices are the individuals of a town that tend to interact locally, and edges represent transmission probability. Each layer corresponds to a different interaction that occurs daily, such as "household", "work" or "school", with their own transmission probability. Our simulations indicate that locking down "friendship" layer has the highest impact in slowing down epidemics. Hence, our contributions are twofold, first we propose a parametric network generator model; second, we run SIR simulations on it and show the impact of layers.},

We define load at each vertex as the accumulated total number of data packets passing through that vertex when every pair of vertices send and receive a data packet along the shortest path connecting the pair. It is found that the load distribution follows a power-law with the exponent $\delta \approx 2.2(1)$, insensitive to different values of $\gamma$ in the range, $2 < \gamma \le 3$, and different mean degrees, which is valid for both undirected and directed cases. Thus, we conjecture that the load exponent is a universal quantity to characterize scale-free networks.},

  abstract  = {We propose an agent-based opinion formation model characterised by a two-fold novelty. First, we
realistically assume that each agent cannot measure the opinion of its neighbours about a given statement with
infinite resolution and accuracy, and hence it can only perceive the opinion of others as agreeing much more, or
more, or comparably, or less, or much less (than itself) with that given statement. This leads to a classification-
based rule for opinion update. Second, we consider three complementary agent traits suggested by significant
sociological and psychological research: conformism, radicalism and stubbornness. We rely on World Values
Survey data to show that the proposed model has the potential to predict the evolution of opinions in real life:
the classification-based approach and complementary agent traits produce rich collective behaviours, such as
polarisation, consensus, and clustering, which can yield predicted opinions similar to survey results.},

  abstract      = {We propose an SIRS compartmental model with demography and fast information and misinformation spreading in the population. The analysis of the complete 6-dimensional system shows the existence of seven equilibrium points. Since under our assumptions the system evolves on two time scales, we completely characterize the possible asymptotic behaviours with techniques of Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory (GSPT). During our analysis of the fast dynamics, we identify three branches of the critical manifold, which exist under determined conditions. We perform a theoretical bifurcation analysis of the fast system to understand the relation between these three equilibria when varying specific parameters of the fast system. We then observed a delayed loss of stability on the various branches of the critical manifold, as the slow dynamics may cause the branches to lose their hyperbolicity. We emphasise how the inclusion of (mis)information spreading, even in low dimensional compartmental models, can radically alter the asymptotic behaviour of the epidemic. We conclude with numerical simulations of various remarkable scenarios.},

  abstract  = {In complex social networks, the decision-making mechanisms behind human actions and the cognitive processes that shape opinion formation processes are often intertwined, leading to complex and varied collective emergent behavior. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model that captures such a coevolution of actions and opinions. Following a discrete-time process, each individual decides between binary actions, aiming to coordinate with the actions of other members observed on a network of interactions and taking into account their own opinion. At the same time, the opinion of each individual evolves due to the opinions shared by other members, the actions observed on the network, and, possibly, an external influence source. We provide a global convergence result for a special case of the coupled dynamics. Steady state configurations in which all the individuals take the same action are then studied, elucidating the role of the model parameters and the network structure on the collective behavior of the system.},

Such heterogeneity may be, for example, spatial, temporal or behavioral in form. Generally, models that include population subdivision have assumed that individuals are permanently assigned to given behavioral states represented by the subpopulations. We consider a simple epidemic model in which a behavioral trait affects disease transmission, and this trait may be transferred among hosts as a consequence of social interaction. This creates a situation where the frequencies of different behavioral traits and disease states as well as their associations may change over time. We consider the impact of the culturally transmitted trait on the criterion for initial spread of the disease. We also explore the evolution of cultural traits in response to pathogen dynamics and show some conditions under which behavioral traits that reduce transmission evolve. We find that behaviors increasing the risk of infection can also evolve when they are inherently favored or when there is sufficient clustering of contacts between like behaviors. & 2002 Elsevier Science (USA)},

In the modeling process it is assumed that disease spreads due to the contact between susceptibles and infectives only. The growth rate of awareness programs impacting the population is assumed to be proportional to the number of infective individuals. It is further assumed that due to the effect of media, susceptible individuals form a separate class and avoid contact with the infectives. The model is analyzed by using stability theory of differential equations. The model analysis shows that the spread of an infectious disease can be controlled by using awareness programs but the disease remains endemic due to immigration. The simulation analysis of the model confirms the analytical results.},

  abstract  = {Disease transmission and behaviour change are both fundamentally social phenomena. Behaviour change can have profound consequences for disease transmission, and epidemic conditions can favour the more rapid adoption of behavioural innovations. We analyse a simple model of coupled behaviour change and infection in a structured population characterised by homophily and outgroup aversion. Outgroup aversion slows the rate of adoption and can lead to lower rates of adoption in the later-adopting group or even behavioural divergence between groups when outgroup aversion exceeds positive ingroup influence. When disease dynamics are coupled to the behaviour-adoption model, a wide variety of outcomes are possible. Homophily can either increase or decrease the final size of the epidemic depending on its relative strength in the two groups and on R 0 for the infection. For example, if the first group is homophilous and the second is not, the second group will have a larger epidemic. Homophily and outgroup aversion can also produce dynamics suggestive of a 'second wave' in the first group that follows the peak of the epidemic in the second group. Our simple model reveals dynamics that are suggestive of the processes currently observed under pandemic conditions in culturally and/or politically polarised populations such as the USA.},

Using threshold models to describe how and why some people assert opinions and others do not, the paper argues that to better describe the dynamics of opinion assertion and quiescence the model must be able to account for the fact that different individuals differ in the importance they place on the actions of others, and in the networks in which they are embedded. The paper reports on simulations incorporating these aspects into the model, yielding an improved representation of public opinion dynamics. Further, the incorporation of networks and weighting systems in the model alleviates one of the problematic features of the simple threshold models described by Granovetter, namely that certain individuals play unrealistically key roles in the contagion process. When networks are accounted for, the threshold formulation is less likely to make the group dynamic so dependent upon the behaviors of specific individuals.},

Some of these models describe the dynamics of specific infections in a very detailed way, while others discuss the general properties that emerge from a broad theoretical framework. Chapter 1 describes the dynamics of directly transmitted viral and bacterial infections of man, and focuses on the concept of herd immunity and its significance in the design of vaccination programmes. It introduces the notion of the basic reproductive rate of an infection, and shows how this parameter plays a central role both in determining observed epidemiological patterns and in the design of policies for disease control.},
