  abstract      = {The last two years have been an extraordinary time with the Covid-19 pandemic killing millions, affecting and distressing billions of people worldwide. Authorities took various measures such as turning school and work to remote and prohibiting social relations via curfews. In order to mitigate the negative impact of the epidemics, researchers tried to estimate the future of the pandemic for different scenarios, using forecasting techniques and epidemics simulations on networks. Networks used in these research are either synthetic networks or real networks with limited size and domain specific interactions. Hence, their ability to represent the world is limited. Intending to represent real-life in an urban town in high resolution, we propose a parametric multi-layer undirected weighted network model, where vertices are the individuals of a town that tend to interact locally, and edges represent transmission probability. Each layer corresponds to a different interaction that occurs daily, such as "household", "work" or "school", with their own transmission probability. Our simulations indicate that locking down "friendship" layer has the highest impact in slowing down epidemics. Hence, our contributions are twofold, first we propose a parametric network generator model; second, we run SIR simulations on it and show the impact of layers.},

We define load at each vertex as the accumulated total number of data packets passing through that vertex when every pair of vertices send and receive a data packet along the shortest path connecting the pair. It is found that the load distribution follows a power-law with the exponent $\delta \approx 2.2(1)$, insensitive to different values of $\gamma$ in the range, $2 < \gamma \le 3$, and different mean degrees, which is valid for both undirected and directed cases. Thus, we conjecture that the load exponent is a universal quantity to characterize scale-free networks.},

  abstract  = {We propose an agent-based opinion formation model characterised by a two-fold novelty. First, we
realistically assume that each agent cannot measure the opinion of its neighbours about a given statement with
infinite resolution and accuracy, and hence it can only perceive the opinion of others as agreeing much more, or
more, or comparably, or less, or much less (than itself) with that given statement. This leads to a classification-
based rule for opinion update. Second, we consider three complementary agent traits suggested by significant
sociological and psychological research: conformism, radicalism and stubbornness. We rely on World Values
Survey data to show that the proposed model has the potential to predict the evolution of opinions in real life:
the classification-based approach and complementary agent traits produce rich collective behaviours, such as
polarisation, consensus, and clustering, which can yield predicted opinions similar to survey results.},

  abstract = {We propose an SIRS compartmental model with demography and fast information and misinformation spreading in the population. The analysis of the complete 6-dimensional system shows the existence of seven equilibrium points. Since under our assumptions the system evolves on two time scales, we completely characterize the possible asymptotic behaviours with techniques of Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory (GSPT). During our analysis of the fast dynamics, we identify three branches of the critical manifold, which exist under determined conditions. We perform a theoretical bifurcation analysis of the fast system to understand the relation between these three equilibria when varying specific parameters of the fast system. We then observed a delayed loss of stability on the various branches of the critical manifold, as the slow dynamics may cause the branches to lose their hyperbolicity. We emphasise how the inclusion of (mis)information spreading, even in low dimensional compartmental models, can radically alter the asymptotic behaviour of the epidemic. We conclude with numerical simulations of various remarkable scenarios.},

  abstract = {This paper concerns the problem of agent trust in an electronic market place. We maintain that agent trust involves making decisions under uncertainty and therefore the phenomenon should be modelled probabilistically. We therefore propose a probabilistic framework that models agent interactions as a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The observations of the HMM are the interaction outcomes and the hidden state is the underlying probability of a good outcome. The task of deciding whether to interact with another agent reduces to probabilistic inference of the current state of that agent given all previous interaction outcomes. The model is extended to include a probabilistic reputation system which involves agents gathering opinions about other agents and fusing them with their own beliefs. Our system is fully probabilistic and hence delivers the following improvements with respect to previous work: (a) the model assumptions are faithfully translated into algorithms; our system is optimal under those assumptions. (b) It can account for agents whose behaviour is not static with time (c) it can estimate the rate with which an agent's behaviour changes. The system is shown to significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art methods in several numerical experiments.},

  abstract  = {Human mobility is a key component of large-scale spatial-transmission models of infectious diseases. Correctly modeling and quantifying human mobility is critical for improving epidemic control, but may be hindered by data incompleteness or unavailability. Here we explore the opportunity of using proxies for individual mobility to describe commuting flows and predict the diffusion of an influenza-like-illness epidemic. We consider three European countries and the corresponding commuting networks at different resolution scales, obtained from (i) official census surveys, (ii) proxy mobility data extracted from mobile phone call records, and (iii) the radiation model calibrated with census data. Metapopulation models defined on these countries and integrating the different mobility layers are compared in terms of epidemic observables. We show that commuting networks from mobile phone data capture the empirical commuting patterns well, accounting for more than 87% of the total fluxes. The distributions of commuting fluxes per link from mobile phones and census sources are similar and highly correlated, however a systematic overestimation of commuting traffic in the mobile phone data is observed. This leads to epidemics that spread faster than on census commuting networks, once the mobile phone commuting network is considered in the epidemic model, however preserving to a high degree the order of infection of newly affected locations. Proxies' calibration affects the arrival times' agreement across different models, and the observed topological and traffic discrepancies among mobility sources alter the resulting epidemic invasion patterns. Results also suggest that proxies perform differently in approximating commuting patterns for disease spread at different resolution scales, with the radiation model showing higher accuracy than mobile phone data when the seed is central in the network, the opposite being observed for peripheral locations. Proxies should therefore be chosen in light of the desired accuracy for the epidemic situation under study.},

Unfortunately, public health messages can be undermined by competing misinformation and conspiracy theories, spread virally through communities that are already distrustful of expert opinion. In this article, we propose and analyse a simple model of the interaction between disease spread and awareness dynamics in a heterogeneous population composed of both trusting individuals who seek better quality information and will take precautionary measures, and distrusting individuals who reject better quality information and have overall riskier behaviour. We show that, as the density of the distrusting population increases, the model passes through a phase transition to a state in which major outbreaks cannot be suppressed. Our work highlights the urgent need for effective interventions to increase trust and inform the public.},

  abstract  = {In complex social networks, the decision-making mechanisms behind human actions and the cognitive processes that shape opinion formation processes are often intertwined, leading to complex and varied collective emergent behavior. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model that captures such a coevolution of actions and opinions. Following a discrete-time process, each individual decides between binary actions, aiming to coordinate with the actions of other members observed on a network of interactions and taking into account their own opinion. At the same time, the opinion of each individual evolves due to the opinions shared by other members, the actions observed on the network, and, possibly, an external influence source. We provide a global convergence result for a special case of the coupled dynamics. Steady state configurations in which all the individuals take the same action are then studied, elucidating the role of the model parameters and the network structure on the collective behavior of the system.},

  abstract  = {The focus of the growing discipline of behavioral epidemiology (BE) of
infectious diseases is on individual behavior as a key determinant of infection trajec-
tories. This overview departs from the central, but static, role of human behavior in
traditional mathematical models of infection to motivate the importance of including
behavior into epidemiological models. Our aim is threefold. First, we attempt to
motivate the historical and cultural background underpinning the BE revolution,
focusing on the issue of rational opposition to vaccines as a natural endpoint of
the changed relation between man and disease in modern industrialized countries.
Second, we review those contributions, from both mathematical epidemiology and
economics, that forerun the current “epidemic” of studies on BE. Last, we offer
a more detailed overview of the current epidemic phase of BE studies and, still
motivated by the issue of immunization choices, introduce some baseline ideas
and models.},

  abstract  = {The effect of heterogeneity within populations on the spread of infectious diseases has been a recent focus of research. Such heterogeneity may be, for example, spatial, temporal or behavioral in form. Generally, models that include population subdivision have assumed that individuals are permanently assigned to given behavioral states represented by the subpopulations. We consider a simple epidemic model in which a behavioral trait affects disease transmission, and this trait may be transferred among hosts as a consequence of social interaction. This creates a situation where the frequencies of different behavioral traits and disease states as well as their associations may change over time. We consider the impact of the culturally transmitted trait on the criterion for initial spread of the disease. We also explore the evolution of cultural traits in response to pathogen dynamics and show some conditions under which behavioral traits that reduce transmission evolve. We find that behaviors increasing the risk of infection can also evolve when they are inherently favored or when there is sufficient clustering of contacts between like behaviors. & 2002 Elsevier Science (USA)},

In the modeling process it is assumed that disease spreads due to the contact between susceptibles and infectives only. The growth rate of awareness programs impacting the population is assumed to be proportional to the number of infective individuals. It is further assumed that due to the effect of media, susceptible individuals form a separate class and avoid contact with the infectives. The model is analyzed by using stability theory of differential equations. The model analysis shows that the spread of an infectious disease can be controlled by using awareness programs but the disease remains endemic due to immigration. The simulation analysis of the model confirms the analytical results.},

  abstract  = {Disease transmission and behaviour change are both fundamentally social phenomena. Behaviour change can have profound consequences for disease transmission, and epidemic conditions can favour the more rapid adoption of behavioural innovations. We analyse a simple model of coupled behaviour change and infection in a structured population characterised by homophily and outgroup aversion. Outgroup aversion slows the rate of adoption and can lead to lower rates of adoption in the later-adopting group or even behavioural divergence between groups when outgroup aversion exceeds positive ingroup influence. When disease dynamics are coupled to the behaviour-adoption model, a wide variety of outcomes are possible. Homophily can either increase or decrease the final size of the epidemic depending on its relative strength in the two groups and on R 0 for the infection. For example, if the first group is homophilous and the second is not, the second group will have a larger epidemic. Homophily and outgroup aversion can also produce dynamics suggestive of a 'second wave' in the first group that follows the peak of the epidemic in the second group. Our simple model reveals dynamics that are suggestive of the processes currently observed under pandemic conditions in culturally and/or politically polarised populations such as the USA.},

Going beyond searching for 'intelligent' collectives, we integrate research from different disciplines and outline modelling approaches that can be used to begin answering questions such as why collectives sometimes fail to reach seemingly obvious solutions, how they change their strategies and network structures in response to different problems and how we can anticipate and perhaps change future harmful societal trajectories. We discuss the importance of considering path dependence, lack of optimization and collective myopia to understand the sometimes counterintuitive outcomes of collective adaptation. We call for a transdisciplinary, quantitative and societally useful social science that can help us to understand our rapidly changing and ever more complex societies, avoid collective disasters and reach the full potential of our ability to organize in adaptive collectives.},
