  abstract      = {The last two years have been an extraordinary time with the Covid-19 pandemic killing millions, affecting and distressing billions of people worldwide. Authorities took various measures such as turning school and work to remote and prohibiting social relations via curfews. In order to mitigate the negative impact of the epidemics, researchers tried to estimate the future of the pandemic for different scenarios, using forecasting techniques and epidemics simulations on networks. Networks used in these research are either synthetic networks or real networks with limited size and domain specific interactions. Hence, their ability to represent the world is limited. Intending to represent real-life in an urban town in high resolution, we propose a parametric multi-layer undirected weighted network model, where vertices are the individuals of a town that tend to interact locally, and edges represent transmission probability. Each layer corresponds to a different interaction that occurs daily, such as "household", "work" or "school", with their own transmission probability. Our simulations indicate that locking down "friendship" layer has the highest impact in slowing down epidemics. Hence, our contributions are twofold, first we propose a parametric network generator model; second, we run SIR simulations on it and show the impact of layers.},

We define load at each vertex as the accumulated total number of data packets passing through that vertex when every pair of vertices send and receive a data packet along the shortest path connecting the pair. It is found that the load distribution follows a power-law with the exponent $\delta \approx 2.2(1)$, insensitive to different values of $\gamma$ in the range, $2 < \gamma \le 3$, and different mean degrees, which is valid for both undirected and directed cases. Thus, we conjecture that the load exponent is a universal quantity to characterize scale-free networks.},

  abstract  = {We propose an agent-based opinion formation model characterised by a two-fold novelty. First, we
realistically assume that each agent cannot measure the opinion of its neighbours about a given statement with
infinite resolution and accuracy, and hence it can only perceive the opinion of others as agreeing much more, or
more, or comparably, or less, or much less (than itself) with that given statement. This leads to a classification-
based rule for opinion update. Second, we consider three complementary agent traits suggested by significant
sociological and psychological research: conformism, radicalism and stubbornness. We rely on World Values
Survey data to show that the proposed model has the potential to predict the evolution of opinions in real life:
the classification-based approach and complementary agent traits produce rich collective behaviours, such as
polarisation, consensus, and clustering, which can yield predicted opinions similar to survey results.},
