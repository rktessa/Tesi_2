# Meta data analysis
 November 2023
 
## Objectives
One of the main objectives of the Masterâ€™s degree Thesis is to analyse the functional shape of opinion-based surveys taken by Meta during the Covid-19 epidemic spread. In fact, for a period of almost two years a survey is proposed to Facebook users, that can respond voluntarily. The questions in the surveys are about health status and behaviour. 

Here we want to extrapolate different results of this survey:
-	First it is interesting observe the functional shape, describing the real volution of habits and opinions of people in the world;
-	second it is performed a comparison between these real data dynamics and the evolution of the opinion-disease model that we have implemented. 


## Work in progress

- Daniele file "Explorative_data" is a powerfull toolkit to use the data from the survey

- try to extrapolate some interesting functional shape searching in the database
