# Work to do:

- Write differential equation of the model, in the simplest form and study of its behaviour while changing the constant coefficient, that reguletes the dynamic.  
- solve the ODEs with numerical integration
- realize a heat map to plot the result
- analyze data like the graph about mask wearing from Meta to observe the shape of the curve
- read the Introduction of Bertozzi to understand the previuos work they consider.
- focus on article about governement, broadcast effect (Bertozzi introduction)
- understand the relation of these work with my research interest
- look at the extension about Bertozzi work
